### Additional information

Coffee first arrived in Guatemala in the 18th century with Jesuits to the monasteries of Antigua. Estates began to spread over the following 150 years, primarily owned by European colonists. The country gained independence in 1821, and coffee production soared, making Guatemala an important coffee producer.

The Agrarian Reform Law was passed in 1952, redistributing the land of 1,700 estates to nearly 500,000 locals and indigenous peoples. However, a civil war ensued for 36 years, hindering coffee production.

Soon, coffee regained its prominence, and Guatemala is now home to some exceptional coffees. A quarter of the population are in some way involved with growing or processing coffee. In the prominent volcanic coffee producing region of Acatenango is the town of San Pedro Yepocapa and the location of Finca El Mirador, the source of this lot.

The De la Roca family ran the farm for 40 years until in 2015 the land was sold to Stuardo Coto, who added it to his Panorama Estate. The organization is dedicated to growing coffee with respect to the environment whilst ensuring high quality is maintained. His team diligently monitors the soil fertility, pruning, fertilizing, and pest management of each farm within the organization.

The slopes of Finca El Mirador are filled with Pacamara and Geisha. Thanks to the high altitude and ideal climate, this farm is utilized primarily for growing high quality coffee rather than quantity.

During the harvest, the cherries are carefully handpicked and delivered by truck to the wet mill located in Antigua, 2 hours away. The cherries are then examined and sorted to remove any under or overripe cherries.

Next, the cherries are pulped via machine then fermented in plastic barrels for 36 hours. After fermentation, the coffee is washed by hand in correteos to remove any remaining mucilage or debris. Finally, the coffee is dispersed evenly on patios to dry in the open sun. On the first day, the coffee is moved every 30 minutes, then every hour the following day, and every hour and a half for the remainder of drying time, which lasts 15 â€“ 20 days. Once dried, the coffee is rested, then hulled, and prepared for export.
