### Additional information:

This extraordinary coffee hails from the world-famous Finca Lérida – the first coffee plantation ever established in Panama and still renowned today as producing some of the best and most desirable coffees in the world. With its idyllic setting and fascinating origin story, it’s no wonder that they are so well-known. But the true secret of its reputation lies in the cup. Finca Lérida is comprised of five different farms, including the Lérida Estate, where this lot was grown.

Finca Lérida was established in 1917 by Tollef Bache Mönniche, a Norwegian engineer and graduate of the Royal College of Dresden, Germany. Mönniche was incredibly important to Panama during the turn of the century, leading Nelson Rounsevell to write in 1934, “If there is someone whose life and activities are identified with the Isthmus and deserve that his achievements be written, that someone is Mönniche.”
