### Additional information

This extraordinary coffee hails from the world-famous Finca Lérida - the first coffee plantation ever established in Panama and still renowned today as producing some of the best and most desirable coffees in the world. With its idyllic setting and fascinating origin story, it's no wonder that they are so well-known. But the true secret of its reputation lies in the cup. Finca Lérida is comprised of five different farms, including the Lérida Estate, where this lot was grown.

Finca Lérida was established in 1917 by Tollef Bache Mönniche, a Norwegian engineer and graduate of the Royal College of Dresden, Germany. Mönniche was incredibly important to Panama during the turn of the century, leading Nelson Rounsevell to write in 1934, "If there is someone whose life and activities are identified with the Isthmus and deserve that his achievements be written, that someone is Mönniche."

Mönniche was born on August 27 of 1874 in Sumadalen, Norway. His parents were Carl Alexander Mönniche and Sofia Gudrun Bache. He lived in his hometown during his early childhood, and in 1894 he graduated from Norway School of War in Oslo. He served as a lieutenant in the Norwegian Royal Army, while studying civil engineering in the University of Dresde, Germany, where he graduated with honours in
1901. Almost immediately he moved to United States.

Here his professional career developed quickly. Among some of his engineering works were the viaduct of Manhattan Valley, the New York Subway (over Riverside Drive), the Railroad of Pennsylvania, many subways, and elevated railways in Philadelphia (for Rapid Transit Co.), concrete retaining walls for the Subway of Philadelphia, The Railroad Station of Pennsylvania in Washington, the New York River Bridge and the East River Bridge (Both bridges in Virginia).

In October of 1907, Mönniche received a call from Washington proposing a 10-year project: the construction the Panama Canal. Tollef accepted and his first job as assistant engineer was in the Division of Locks and Dams in the Commission of Canal of the Isthmus, in Washington. He was transferred the following year to Panama, as design engineer in charge of six emergency dams for the locks.

These Dams were a peerless element of the Canal. None of the characteristics of the structure had precedents. Up until that time, the heaviest structures weighed around 2,800 tonnes. The Dams of Mönniche, as they were called, weighted 3,400 tonnes.

Mönniche finished his extraordinary work in 1914, at which point he became Dike Engineer in charge of the design and construction of Cristobal Dock Terminal of the Panama Railroad in Colon. In 1917, he resigned his service and retired to live in the mountains of Boquete with his wife.

Julia Trible Huger, Mönniche's wife, was descendant of the first colonising families of the United States. Her grandfather was very well-known in the south, especially in Virginia, her hometown. Julia took with her to the high lands of Boquete a sword of her ancestors that was used in the Independence War of the Thirteen Colonies (1773 - 1783).

When Mönniche arrived in Boquete, he purchased an area of land from a farmer called "Lerida" (Named after a city founded by Moors in Spain). Even though he thought to stay just for a short while to recover from the hard work of ten long years, he built a house with the wood from the place and began to consider starting a coffee farm.

The farm was remote. When the Mönniche first began living on "Lerida", they used kerosene lamps and brought water from a brook. Mrs. Julia used to cook on a wood burning stove. In those times the journey took 5 days from Panama City to David, and 2 more days on horse to get to Boquete, where only one trail could take you to "Lerida." Despite this, the couple took to farming and ended up staying on and expanding the farm far longer than expected.

The singular couple ended up owning 365 hectares in the end. Green coffee, vegetables, and diverse fruits like: strawberries, pears, blackberries, and plums surrounded their new home. From Guatemala, Mönniche brought varieties of avocados that today grow all over Boquete. They raised turkeys, chicken, cows, and horses. They opened and administrative office to supply their numerous employees with necessary supplies.

Even though austere and disciplined, The Mönniches knew how to earn the love of the people who met them. Tollef, overall, was a very fair man; he paid to every person their just dues, depending on the job they had performed.

Every Christmas, The Mönniches tasked one of their top employees to visit the home of every employee to count how many children they had. The point of this census was to provide to every child with a present, some of which were brought from the United States. On the same date as the gift exchange, they would also organise a huge feast for all the families living and working on the farm.

Despite the many hardships and the lack of infrastructure, The Mönniches developed a flourishing and beautiful coffee farm that that has done a great deal to put Boquete on the map. In 1929 the harvest was remarkable: 930 quintals (204,600 pounds) from only 12,000 coffee plants. The best part of this harvest was taken to Germany, where the first exportation of Panamanian coffee was well received, selling it at 3 times more than the current market price of that time.

Monniche conserved 100 hectares of the virgin jungle as his primordial reserve. Mönniche had a passion for nature that later would be known abroad. He was a consecrated naturalist, and during the 40 years he remained in the damp mountains of Boquete he endeavoured to collect all the species of bird he found.
The collection was so comprehensive that it was acquired by the Museum of Natural History of Chicago in 1956.

This conserve also served to ensure a sufficient water supply for coffee processing. In order to access this clean water, he built a pond of 40 square feet and 7 of depth. He took 2 inch tubes by horse and men throughout Lerida's trail to the virgin jungle in order to extract water. He himself built most of the machinery for the coffee and several of his inventions like the "sifon"- a density sorting device made to separate good beans from the bad - are still used in not only Boquete but also coffee plantations worldwide now use this device, including Finca Lerida, where it is still used to select the best cherries for processing for export.

In 1956, the Mönniches abandoned forever their Quiel abolde, selling their lands to Alfredo and Inga Collins and returning to the United States. After spending some time in Roanoke, Virginia, where the couple first got married, they relocated to Austin, Texas. Tollef passed away in December of 1958, at the age of 84.

The farm is currently managed by Maria Antonella Amoruso who carries on the Mönniches' legacy. She co-ordinates the coffee growing (continuing to win prizes every year), protect the virgin rainforest surrounding the farm and runs Boutique Finca Lerida which offers visitors the opportunity to stay on the farm. Finca Lérida's reputation dates as far back as the first shipment of coffee that Panama exported to Germany in 1929, when the high quality of the coffee produced at this plantation made its international buyers realise that there was more to Panama than just its Canal.

Lérida Estate is the fourth farm within the Finca Lérida farms and is situated in the well-known coffee region of Alto Quiel in Boquete. This is the main and largest farm, spanning 70 hectares with 30 hectares of protected forest. The wet and dry mill for all the farms are also located here. Geisha, Typica, SL28, SL34, Orange Bourbon, and Catuaí, are grown here. This coffee was grown at 1,900 meters above sea level and is comprised solely of SL28. During the harvest, once the cherries reach peak ripeness, they are carefully handpicked, then delivered to the wet mill. Here, they are submerged in tanks of water to remove the floaters, or lower quality cherries. Next, they are dispersed on raised beds and covered to dry in the open sun with some shade for 25 days.
