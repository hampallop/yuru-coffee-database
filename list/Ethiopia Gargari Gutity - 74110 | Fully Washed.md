### Additional information

Grown in the well-known Yirgacheffe region of Ethiopia, this coffee comes from a collection of smallholder producers in the town of Gedeb.

Coffee is a family crop - grown by households within small gardens, on less than one hectare of land. Producers line their homes with coffee trees, and it is the primary source of income. It is common for producers to intercrop enset, the Ethiopian banana, avocados, and papaya to have additional food sources.

Although this is an ancient and rich coffee-producing region; producers are still facing threats such as climate change and alterations in the environment. Additionally, as the climate shifts to warmer and moister conditions - it is creating a more habitable area for the Coffee Berry Borer, a common coffee pest in Ethiopia. On top of that, producers also struggle with the fluctuating market and high input costs.

To combat these obstacles, producers have begun to work with agricultural development agents to create new environmental protection projects. These projects include removing older trees and replanting with more sustainable varieties. To ameliorate the ever-changing market, various stakeholder organizations are working to pay fairer prices to the producers.

Another way producers ensure the environmental conditions, and the quality of their coffee are maintained is by regulating the soil health. This is done via incorporation of compost into the soil. Shade trees are also planted throughout each farm - providing an ideal climate for coffee whilst promoting nutrient health within the soil. Coffee producers in Ethiopia are classified as 'passive organic," meaning that they have 100% organic production methods, but are unable to afford the high certification fees. Natural methods are used to fertilize the soil and prevent the spread of pests and diseases; especially since producers lack access to chemical inputs.

After the coffee is carefully hand-picked by each producer - they are carried to the washing station. This is sometimes an 8km journey that is done on foot, with a donkey, or with a motorbike. Upon arrival, the cherries are immediately sorted to remove under and overripe cherries. Next, the cherries are placed in channels of water to begin the washing process. The channel of water pushes the coffee to the de-pulper, which removes the exterior fruit of the cherry. Once washed, the coffee is then submerged in a concrete tank of water to ferment for 48 - 72 hours. The coffee is then rushed through another channel of water to remove any remaining mucilage or foreign material. Lastly, the coffee is evenly dispersed on raised beds to dry in the open sun and covered mid-day to prevent cracking.

Once dried, the beans are trucked to the dry mill, located near the capital city, Addis Ababa. At the dry mill, a pre-cleaning machine removes foreign matter, metal, and stones. The polisher removes the parchment, and silver skin. After polishing, the coffee is graded based on screen size and placed in a gravity separator to remove lightweight and broken coffee beans. Colour sorters provide another layer of quality control, by removing defected beans. A final look by hand is done to ensure nothing was missed.

Varieties of coffee grown here are traditionally referred to as 'heirloom' by exporters - a catchall terminology which often masks the wide assortment of varieties that may be present within various regions...even, within farms. Many of these varieties will have been developed by Ethiopia's Jimma Agricultural Research Centre (JARC), which, since the late 1960s, has worked to develop resistant and tasty varieties for the Ethiopian coffee industry and also to provide the agricultural extension training needed to cultivate them.

### About the Yirgacheffe Region

Yirgacheffe is actually part of the Gedeo Zone, Southern Nations region, in southern Ethiopia, but its exquisite, washed coffees are so well-known that is has been sub-divided into its own micro-region. This steep, green area is both fertile and high - much of the coffee grows at 2,000m and above.

At first glance, Yirgacheffe's hills look thickly forested - but in fact, it is a heavily populated region, and the hills are dotted with many dwellings and villages' growing what is known as 'garden coffee'. There are approximately 26 cooperatives in the region, representing some 43,794 farmers and around 62,004 hectares of garden coffee. The production is predominantly washed, although a smaller number of sundried coffees also come out of Yirgacheffe.

Around 85 per cent of Ethiopians still live rurally and make a living from agriculture; each family usually lives in a modest home (often a single round mud hut) and farms their own plot of land, where they grow both cash crops and food for their own consumption. In Yirgacheffe, coffee is one of the main cash crops - covering from half a hectare to 1.5 hectares (the latter is considered big). This is usually planted alongside a second cash crop - often a large-leafed tree used in making roofs for (and also shade provider for the coffee known as 'false banana'. This looks like a banana tree but is not - instead, its thick stem is used to produce both a nutritious flour and a fermented paste that are staple ingredients (particularly across southern Ethiopia).

There is only one main harvest a year in Ethiopia - this usually takes place in November and December across all of the country's growing regions. There are, on average, 4 passes made during the harvest period, and, in regions that produce both washed and naturals, the last pass is used for the natural coffee. Washed coffees are then generally pulped on the same day that they are picked (usually in the evening/night), sorted into three grades by weight (heavy, medium and floaters), fermented (times vary - usually between 16 and 48 hours), washed and then usually graded again in the washing channels. The beans are then dried on African beds, where they are hand-sorted, usually by women.

### About the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange and Traceability

For many years, Ethiopian coffee, some of the best in the world, was for the most part untraceable.

Starting in 2008, Ethiopia began the centralization of all coffee exports through the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX), where the coffees were 'anonymised', stripped of any information other than region, in the interest of the farmers, who were meant to receive top dollar for quality regardless of the 'name' of the washing station or farm. Coffees moving through the ECX were (still are delivered to certified coffee labs, where they were cupped according to profile then graded and marked generically for export. This
'equalising' measure certainly benefitted some producers, but it had the negative impact of eliminating most roasters' and importers' ability to provide accurate information of the precise traceability of coffees.
Even after the opening of the 'second window' (devised for direct sales of cooperative and certified coffee), as of the end of 2017 some 90 percent of coffees still moved through the ECX.

The end of March 2017 saw a huge overturning of this mandatory system. In a bill raised by the Ethiopian Coffee & Tea Development and Marketing Authority, Ethiopian coffee (even that sold through the ECX) can be marketed and sold with full traceability intact. The aim is to limit black market dealings, to demand higher prices and to enable Ethiopian producers to share in a greater piece of the pie.

In a bit more detail, the new system allows any exporter with a valid license to sell directly to buyers without placing the coffee on the ECX first. There is a slight caveat - the parchment coffee will have to be sold within three days of arriving at the processing plant in Addis. If it is still unsold after three days (which is quite likely). it must be sold through the ECX: BUT with its traceability info intact rather than being deleted.
