### Additional information:

Ever stop to think about all the variables that factor into creating a distinct, complex, clean and consistent regional blend? It is mind boggling if you think about terroir to processing and everything in between. And what about the human factor from farm management all the way through to brewing. Even more mind boggling. But if you think about it, the backbone of Colombian offerings are regional blends cultivated in many parts on small family owned farms. It’s hard to pinpoint why some regional blends rise to the top each year but it sure is exciting when they do. This traceable community blend with a vibrant regional profile comes from 14 producers with small farms in the municipality of Palestina within the department of Huila. Each producer has their own micro-mill where they carefully harvest cherries, depulp, ferment, wash and gently dry the parchment on raised beds. Imagine the harmony between these producers in farm management and post-harvest practices to achieve a clean and consistent blend. But also, just enough differences from farm to farm to create a rich complexity of flavors. And then imaging all the crucial logistical demands for things like warehousing and milling coffee for export before this coffee reached the international market. There is likely an unnamed cupper there in Huila who spent a lot of time putting the small lots together for this exceptional regional blend.
