### Additional information:

This exceptional fully washed coffee was dry milled and exported by Primrose, PLC. The coffee was grown by smallholder farmers producers around the kabele (town) of Haru Suke in Gedeo County, Yirgacheffe region. Most contributing producers own less than a hectare of land, and they grow coffee simply as a backyard cash crop. Coffee will usually be interspersed with other subsistence crops, such as sweet potato, mangos, and avocados, but there are no other primary cash crops grown in the region.

Our partner, Primrose S.P. PLC is a stakeholder in the supplier washing station and works directly with them to control for quality and cultural practices on the farm. Income from coffee is important but minimal for most farmers due to the small size of their farms. As such, inputs are minimal â€“ most coffee grown in the region is 100% organic, though not certified, as producers simply do not have the money to apply chemical fertilisers, pesticides, or herbicides. Primrose ensures that there are agricultural officers who work closely with each producer to ensure the fertility of the farmland. In fact, soon the wet mill and surrounding farmers will also be RFA and UTZ certified.
