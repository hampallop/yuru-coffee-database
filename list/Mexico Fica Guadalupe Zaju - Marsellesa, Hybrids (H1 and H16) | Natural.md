### Additional information:

Representing roughly 2% of global coffee production. Mexico is well-known for its coffee grown in the Chiapas and Oaxacan regions situated in the souther reaches of the country. Coffee first arrived in Mexico with the Spanish colonists in the 18 century. After independence from Spain, the country, although in turmoil, began to slowly cultivate coffee plantations in the southern states. Border disputes with Guatemala ensued as Europeans bought up large swathes of land, pushing indigenous populations into the mountains.

The Mexican Revolution led to Agrarian Reforms redistributing land to local populations. Small-scale coffee production exploded with the creation of the National Coffee Institute of Mexico (INMECAFE) in 1973 yet was dismantled in 1989 following the International Coffee Crisis. With the lack of support from a governing coffee body, producers were then forced to sell coffee at low prices to local coyotes. Thanks to the creation of cooperatives and other producer organizations, producers received more support and were provided with better access to international markets. Today, coffee production has stabilized and remained strong. This lot is one example of how Mexican coffee has prospered.

Beautiful Finca Guadalupe Zaju occupies 310 hectares right on Chiapas, Mexico's famed 'Ruta de Cafe'.
This 'Route of Coffee' rides along the Guatemalan border, north from the border town of Tapachula. through Mexico's famed Soconusco region. The route flows past some of Mexico's most famous farms - including the Fincas Hamburgo and Irlanda. A neighbour of these farms. Guadalupe Zaju is well on its way to helping carry on the region's (somewhat diminished in recent years) reputation as a location for high quality coffee.

The Soconusco region is one of Mexico's most famous coffee locales. Founded in 1890, the region was established by Porfirio Diaz (Mexico's then President) and Offo von Bismarck, who together collaborated to send 450 German families to an underdeveloped region near Tapachula, bordering Guatemala at Mexico's souther tip. The region had great agricultural potential, thought Diaz - but the area was remote and lacked investment. Under the careful management of the German immigrants and with the great effort of local farmers and workers, Soconusco was transformed into coffee powerhouse! Between 1895 and 1900, 11.5 million kg of coffee was harvested - some 70% of which went directly to Germany.

Guadalupe Zaju was taken over in 1945 by Hamburg-bor businessman Hans Asmus Luethje and his Peruvian wife. She was actually Mexican but the fact that she was bor on the neighboring farm "Peru"
