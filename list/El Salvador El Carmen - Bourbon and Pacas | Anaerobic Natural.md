### Additional information

El Carmen Estate is located at 1,300m above sea level in El Salvador’s Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain range, one of Central America’s prime specialty coffee producing areas. The estate has been farmed by the Alfaro family for over a century.

El Carmen lies in the heart of El Salvador’s main ‘protected highway’ of forest, a part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor System that stretches all the way from Mexico down to Panama. In El Salvador, where more than 80% of the country’s coffee is produced under shade, this eco-system is based mainly in the coffee forest. For this reason, coffee farms such as El Carmen play a vital role as a sanctuary for hundreds of the migratory and native bird species found in this part of the world.

The Estate was founded in the middle of the 19th century when Antonio José Alfaro acquired a plot of land near the village of Ataco – meaning ‘Site of Elevated Springs’ in the indigenous Nahuatl language – where he started to produce coffee. His son, Agustin Alfaro, founder of the Salvadoran National Coffee Company, followed in his father’s footsteps and established El Carmen as one of El Salvador’s leading exporters. His efforts were continued by Antonio Alfaro, head of the third generation of this coffee family and are carried through today by Fernando Alfaro, the fourth generation of his family to farm coffee.

This lot is comprised of a blend of Bourbon and Pacas, varietals grown throughout the Estate.

During the harvest, the cherries are hand-picked only when perfectly ripe and delivered to the mill located at the farm. The cherries are sorted for quality, then placed into containers with water and a cocktail of mountain microorganisms, fungus, and bacteria to ferment for 192 hours sealed. This slows down the fermentation process and prevents any growth of mould. Afterwards, the cherries are evenly dispersed on raised beds to dry in the open sun for 25 – 30 days, with constant raking to prevent any mould development. Once drying is complete, the coffee is hulled and prepared for export.
